## Overview
::: tip Context
This game was developed as a personal project during my free time in collaboration with my brother and a few friends. I was responsible for programming and UI design/implementation.
:::

<br />

As part of my Roblox studio projects, I created a 2-player teamwork puzzle obby. Players must collaborate to solve puzzles, press buttons, and complete the obby. The game includes diverse puzzles that emphasize communication and teamwork.

<br />

I developed this project with my brother, who contributed to level design and testing. Friends also helped design levels, adding variety and giving me experience in collaborative development.

<br />

The game features customization options like chat tags and trails, purchasable with coins earned by completing levels.
