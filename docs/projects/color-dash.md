## Overview
Color Dash is a party game created on the Roblox platform where players must run to a platform of the colour that shows up on their screen before the timer runs out, or they will be eliminated.

<br />

This is one of the first published games I created on Roblox, and I wanted to create a fun and engaging experience for players to enjoy with their friends.

<br />

Looking back and reflecting on this game is a great reminder of how far I've come, especially in regards to my knowledge and skills on the Roblox platform and with Lua development.
