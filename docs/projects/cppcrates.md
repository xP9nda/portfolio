# CPPCrates

### My Role
- Sole Programmer

### Created Using
- C++

### Achievements
- Scored 98/100 marks on the submission for this game

## Overview
As part of one of my first modules at the University of Staffordshire I had the opportunity to learn C++ and develop a console-based game.

<br />

The game I developed is about clicking to earn money, purchasing crates, and hoping for good luck. It has many features, including:
- A crate shop that supports buying crates and viewing the contents of the crates
- A player coins balance that is updated when the player uses coin clickers or gets items from crates
- A moddable JSON backend that allows for easy additions of new crates and items
- A save/load system that allows players to save their progress and load back into the game at a later time

<br />

The game was developed over the course of the module, so about 9 weeks.
