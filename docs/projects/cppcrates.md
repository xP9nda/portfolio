## Overview
::: tip Context
This game was developed for one of my first modules at University of Staffordshire, where I learned C++ to develop a console text-based game.

<br />

This game was developed over the course of the module, 8 weeks.
:::

<br />

The game I developed is about clicking to earn money, purchasing crates, and hoping for good luck. It has many features, including:
- A crate shop that supports buying crates and viewing the contents of the crates
- A player coins balance that is updated when the player uses coin clickers or gets items from crates
- A moddable JSON backend that allows for easy additions of new crates and items
- A save/load system that allows players to save their progress and load back into the game at a later time
