## Overview
::: tip Context
This demo was developed alone as part of a 5 day long game jam during my time at college.
:::

<br />

I created a short mining game demo for this jam, where players must mine into a procedurally generated asteroid to gather resources and upgrade their mining capabilities.

<br />

This demo taught me a lot about managing my time effectively, and cutting features that were not necessary to create an engaging prototype while still meeting the game jam deadline. I also learned about creating game design documents and how to use them to guide my development process.

## Showcase
The gallery below shows some screenshots from the demo.
