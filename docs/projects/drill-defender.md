## Overview
At college I participated in a game jam event, where I worked alone to create a prototype for a game in a week.

<br />

I created a game in which players are the last robot remaining at a forgotten mining outpost, and must mine into the procedural asteroid below them to gather resources to purchase upgrades and increase their mining capabilities.

<br />

This game taught me a lot about managing my time effectively, and cutting features that were not necessary to create an engaging prototype while still meeting the game jam deadline. I also learned about creating game design documents and how to use them to guide my development process.

## Showcase
The gallery below shows some screenshots from the game.
