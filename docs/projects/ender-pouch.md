## Overview
I created a plugin for Minecraft servers that introduces several ender chest related quality of life features.

<br />

This plugin allows staff members to give players "ender pouch" items that act as portable ender chests, allowing players to access their ender chest inventory from anywhere. The plugin also introduces a feature that allows players to access their ender chest inventory from anywhere by using a command, and provides staff utility to open and modify any player's ender chest.

## Showcase
The gallery below shows some screenshots from the project.
