## Overview
::: tip Context
This plugin was developed over a few days as a personal project to help familiarize myself with Java programming.
:::

<br />

I created a plugin for Minecraft servers that introduces several ender chest related quality of life features.

<br />
This plugin lets staff grant players "ender pouch" items, enabling portable access to their ender chest inventory. Players can also use a command to access their ender chest from anywhere, while staff can view and modify any player's ender chest.

## Showcase
The gallery below shows some screenshots from the project.
