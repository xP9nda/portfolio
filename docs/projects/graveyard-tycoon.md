## Overview
My brother and I had the idea to put a twist on the 'typical' Roblox tycoon experience. Normally, these kinds of games have you purely build up a base and earn money, but we wanted to add a bit more depth to the gameplay.

<br />

Graveyard Tycoon has players visit a sprawling underground cave network with distinct locations, where they can find bones, which they can smelt at a crematorium to create ash, which can be sold to a reaper for money.

<br />

Money can be spent on unlocking new areas in the underground which offer more bones as a reward, upgrading your backpack capacity and smelting speed, and building up your graveyard to completion!
