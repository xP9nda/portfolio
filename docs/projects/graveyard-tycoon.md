## Overview
::: tip Context
Graveyard Tycoon was developed as a personal project during my free time in collaboration with my brother. We had the idea to put a twist on the typical Roblox tycoon experience by adding a bit more depth to the gameplay, and wanted to see what we could come up with.
:::

<br />

Graveyard Tycoon has players visit a sprawling underground cave network with distinct locations, where they can find bones, which they can smelt at a crematorium to create ash, which can be sold to a reaper for money.

<br />

Money can be spent on unlocking new areas in the underground which offer more bones as a reward, upgrading your backpack capacity and smelting speed, and building up your graveyard to completion!
