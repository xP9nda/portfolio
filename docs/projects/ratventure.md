# Ratventure

### My Role
- Sole Programmer

### Created Using
- Godot Engine
- GDScript
- Blender

### Achievements
- Achieved 2nd place in the game jam

## Overview
I participated in a 10 day long game jam whilst I was studying at college. I worked alone to create a 3D time-trials platformer game with a theme of 'Sewer'.

<br />

In Ratventure, players take on the role of a rat with a goal to finish a level - find the cheese - as fast as possible. Featuring a data saving system that keeps track of player's best times for each level, I was able to put some thought into level design and create shortcuts and skips that players could learn about and use to improve their times.

<br />

Creating this game was an experience in learning how to create a 3D game in the Godot Engine, and I am glad to have had the opportunity to learn more about the engine and creating 3D games in general. I am proud to say that I achieved 2nd place overall in the game jam.
