# Ropottery

### My Role
- Engine Work, Programming, UI Implementation

### Created Using
- Godot Engine
- GDScript

## Overview
Before my first set of modules began at the University of Staffordshire I participated in a freshers week-long game jam event, and was placed into a team of 5 where I took on the resposibility of implementing the game's mechanics, systems, and UI in engine.

<br />

This project gave me the opportunity to work with others in a team environment, where we played to each other's strengths by dividing the work based on our existing skills and knowledge. I was able to learn a lot about how to communicate effectively with others and how to work together to achieve a common goal.

## Showcase
The gallery below shows some screenshots from the game.
