## Overview
::: tip Context
This game was developed as part of a module teaching Unity at the University of Staffordshire, where I learned C# to develop a 2D game.

<br />

This game was developed over the course of the module, 8 weeks.
:::

<br />

The game I developed is a 2D shooter game where the player must shoot a variety of enemies - shapes - that spawn in waves.

<br />

Enemies provide experience points when killed, which triggers an upgrade on each level up, allowing the player to choose between three randomly picked upgrades, ranging from increases in max health and full heals, to faster weapons and stronger bullets.

<br />

This game contributed more to my knowledge of C# and Unity, and I learned a lot about the engine that I didn't know before thanks to the module at university. I am proud of this game, it plays well, feels polished, and has many features including a main menu, pause menu, settings, varied enemies, varied upgrades, level ups and experience, a modular wave system, detailed stats, visual effects, post processing, and more.

<br />

In particular, I am proud of the UI I created for this game. It is very clean and polished, and I spent a lot of time trying to make sure that it looked good and was easy to use, and I received positive feedback from my peers about it which I am thrilled about.
