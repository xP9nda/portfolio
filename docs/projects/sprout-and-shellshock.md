## Overview
::: tip Context
This game was developed as part of a module teaching Unreal Engine 5 alongside blueprints to prototype games.

<br />

This game was developed over the course of the module, 8 weeks.
:::

<br />

This university module focused on creating a 3D top-down shooter game with a provided framework using a tank character.

<br />

I wanted my game to stand out, so I decided to put a tank somewhere it doesn't belong, in a farm. I created a game where players, instead of shooting enemies, have a watering can and scythe, and must water, harvest, and sell crops to earn money.

<br />

Money can be used to purchase new locations, unlocking new more lucrative crops, with a goal to earn enough money to unlock the final location and beat the game.

<br />

This game received positive feedback from my peers and lecturers during play testing. This module was great to give me a proper introduction to Unreal Engine 5 and blueprints, and I learned a lot about using blueprints effectively for prototyping games. I am proud of this game and think that it is a creative take on the framework provided, and I am happy with the way it turned out.
