## Overview
::: tip Context
I created Surveillance State as part of my college degree, where I challenged myself to learn the Unity engine and create a 3D game demo from scratch.
:::

<br />

This game is a first-person horror experience where the player must monitor security cameras, reporting any anomalous 'incidents' that occur to stay sane and survive the night. The game demo features a single apartment level with a variety of rooms and incidents to look out for.

<br />

This was my first time creating a 3D game in Unity, and I learned a lot about the engine, 3D modelling and texturing, and programming in C#. I am proud of the positive reception the game received in comments on itch.io, and I am glad to have had the opportunity to learn more about the engine and developing 3D games.

## Showcase
The gallery below shows some screenshots from the game.
