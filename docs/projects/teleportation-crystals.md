## Overview
::: tip Context
This plugin was developed as a way of learning Java programming, and was the first plugin I created for Minecraft servers.
:::

<br />

Teleportation Crystals introduces a new method of transportation - the teleportation crystal, items that players can use to save a location, and teleport back there at any time - at the cost of the crystal's 'uses' durability.

<br />

I revisited this plugin a while after its inception to improve it and add features like crystals with infinite uses, and saving yaw/pitch information for a more accurate teleportation experience.

<br />

I extended a lot of customisation to the server owners, who can configure everything about the crystals - from the crafting recipe, sounds, messages, appearance of the crystal, and much more.

## Showcase
The gallery below shows some screenshots from the project.
