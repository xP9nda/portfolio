## Overview
::: tip Context
This game was developed as part of a game jam held by my college, where I created this 2D puzzle/platformer game in Unity over the course of 5 days.
:::

<br />

This game is a 2D puzzle/platformer in which the player takes on the role of a reaper helping souls pass on. The player can choose between six levels, using their ghostly powers to avoid obstacles and progress through the level. The game features a unique mechanic where the player can switch into a 'ghost mode' for 5 seconds at a time, allowing them to pass through walls and other obstacles to find ways to allow their physical body to progress.

<br />

The game received positive feedback from my college peers, and I'm particularly proud of the 2D assets and tilemaps I crafted using Aseprite.

## Showcase
