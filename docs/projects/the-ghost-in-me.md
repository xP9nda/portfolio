# The Ghost in Me

### My Role
- Engine Work, Programming, UI Implementation

### Created Using
- Unity Engine
- C#
- Aseprite

## Overview
This was the first project I made in the Unity engine, and I created it as part of a 5 day long game jam during my college degree.

<br />

This game is a 2D puzzle/platformer in which the player takes on the role of a reaper helping souls pass on. The player can choose between six levels, using their ghostly powers to avoid obstacles and progress through the level. The game features a unique mechanic where the player can switch into a 'ghost mode' for 5 seconds at a time, allowing them to pass through walls and other obstacles to find ways to allow their physical body to progress.

<br />

I received positive feedback from my peers at college about this game, and am proud of the work I put into it, I especially like the 2D assets and tilemaps, which I created myself using Aseprite.

## Showcase
