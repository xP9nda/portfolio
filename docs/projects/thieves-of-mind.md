## Overview
Created as a project under my Roblox studio to participate in a 24 hour game jam with the theme 'Mind Control', Thieves of Mind has you play as an alien marauder with mind control abilities - taking control of the minds of residents in the strange place you find yourself in. The game allows players to steal the belongings of residents, selling them to earn money to upgrade their supernatural abilities.

<br />

This game was made alongside my brother, who did the map design. I was responsible for the programming and UI design and implementation. The game features a few varied locations to steal from, including two house variations, a shop, and even a tool shed.

<br />

It was a fun project to work on, and I didn't take it too seriously, which allowed me to experiment with new ideas and features that I had never tried before. I learned a lot about making a game in such a short time frame and it was a really enjoyable experience.
